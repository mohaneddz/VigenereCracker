# Vigenère Cipher Cracker 🔓

A React-based web application for decrypting messages encoded with the Vigenère cipher. The currently tool offers two decryption methods: direct key input, and Letter 1 to 1 Mapping, with letter frequency analysis and more to come in the future. 
This project was an experiment made in **less than a day**, more on that in the following sections

## Features ✨

- Interactive Vigenère table visualization
- Two decryption modes:
  - Direct key entry for known keys
  - Letter frequency analysis with 1-to-1 letter mapping
- Real-time letter frequency chart
- Character frequency visualization using Chart.js
- Sleek design with Tailwind CSS

## Why did I Make this ? 🤔

Good question, got carried away solving a CTF, and decied to **make my own decryption tool** for the famous encryption method of Vigenère Cipher

## ⚠️ Project Status: Early Beta

> **Warning**: This project is in early development stages. Features may be incomplete or subject to change. Bugs and instability should be expected. Not recommended for production use yet.


## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```

## Usage 🌻

1. Enter your encrypted message in the "Encrypted Message" field
2. Choose your decryption method:
   - "Enter Key" - Input a known Vigenère key
   - "1 To 1 Mapping" - Use frequency analysis to manually map letters
3. The decrypted result will appear in the "Result" field
4. View letter frequencies in the chart below
